The statement of purpose should clearly cover all sections mentioned below: 1. Introduction: The introduction should describe how the user became interested in a particular field. Describe a series of events or narrate a life changing event or justify with a problem the student aims to solve. 2. Career Goals: The SOP should clearly describe the users career goal. The goal should be as specific as possible and should be relevant to the program the user wishes to pursue* 3. Education Background: Write about 2-3 relevant subjects the user studied in undergraduate education - and describe what skills / knowledge the user gained through those subjects and how the gained skills / knowledge is relevant to the program the user is applying to. 4. Projects, Research, Internships & Work Experience: Include paragraphs to describe relevant projects, research work, internships and work experience. The chosen experiences should be relevant to the program applied to and each experience described should explain how it created impact and how it brought the user closer to their career goal. 5. Skills / Knowledge Missing: Include a few knowledge pieces, skills the user is currently missing. These should be knowledge pieces / skills the student needs to achieve their career goal and which the student doesn't currently have. 6. Why this program & university: Write about why applying to the particular program and university is necessary for the user. Explain how the user will get the necessary knowledge, skills through the program & university. Write about specific courses, research work at the university and other activities at the university that would help the student. 7. How the user can contribute to the university: Write how the user can contribute to the university, their peers, classroom discussion and student community. You could also explain how the student's background would enrich their peers experience or help the university in particular research areas. 8. Conclusion: Summarize the main points and reiterate enthusiasm for the program and dedication to succeed. End with a positive note, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to apply. Remember to maintain a clear, concise, and genuine tone throughout the SOP. Focus on demonstrating your passion, qualifications, and alignment with the program and university. Feel free to elaborate on each section and use personal experiences to illustrate your points. The SOP should be free of grammatical and spelling errors and should be between 900 to 1100 words. Also, the SOP should flow properly. Each sentence should connect well with the next. And each paragraph should connect well with the next. Leave a line in between paragraphs. DO NOT REPEAT SENTENCES AND PHRASES AT ALL. End the SOP properly."""
